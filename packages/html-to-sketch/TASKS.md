- Only rect rx used as cornerRadius, ry is ignored.
- Sketch doesn't have transformation matrices in the document format. Object rotation is passed through though. Maybe it SVDs transformation matrices internally into rotation-scale-rotation sequences.

# Port sketch-to-html models over to sketch-constructor

    [] Translate API in nodeToSketch files
    [] Both libs to use the same models

# Smoke test using whatever websites in inject.js

# Make a new branch for adding layout constraints, pseudo elements
    [x] :after and :before pseudo elements

# Nested symbols

- [x] Agent states - compare if has :hover, :focus, :active etc
    - [x] Generate state variant elements
    - [x] getComputedStyle with :foo
    - [x] Create variant names with :foo
    - Doesn't work, since getComputedStyle doesn't do :hover
    - There's a way to do it via Puppeteer https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/4057
    - [x] Shadow root handling for states
        - Can't get it working correctly
        - Ignore Shadow DOM, scale is deprecating it
    - [x] Investigate once more if we can programmatically do them
    - [x] Add :focus
    - [x] Add :active                  
- [x] Symbol names
    - [x] No crazy /null/0
    - [x] If param value long, just remove it
- [x] Override - parse layer name
    - Use layer name as prefix to override style name
    - Deal with instance creation failure
- [x] Create new symbol if frame differs
- [x] Accurate rendering or fewer symbols?
    - Accurate
- [x] Always use node names
- [x] Replace system fonts
- [x] Debug duplicate text styles
    - [x] Instead of name = variant, name = symbol / variant
- [x] Symbol Master text styles should use variant name if symbol master has one.

# Components tests

- [x] Use document as Sketch library
    - [x] Stable document ID
    - [x] Stable symbol IDs
    - [x] Bump symbol changeIdentifier on build

- [x] Better Sketch library stability
    - [x] Store document ID in symbol map
    - [x] Pass in symbol map filename
    - [x] Use Sqlite DB as symbol map
    - [ ] Allow renaming symbols
        - [ ] Use a stable symbol key for components instead of symbol name
        - [ ] symbolKey -> symbolID -map
        - [ ] Default symbolKey to symbol name
